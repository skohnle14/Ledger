## Goal: The task of this assignment is to buiild a blockchain-based ledger with a user-friendly interface. The ledger should allow transactions to be sent peer to peer as well as verify the data in the ledger
### How to run the PyChain: When the webpage on streamlit is up, in the input sender information you put the name of the person sending the amount. This could be a single person or a financial institution. In the input to reciever information you put the same thing except this time you put the person/institution receiving the amount. In the third input box titled amount you put the amount that is going to be sent. Once all the data is put into the program you click add block. The block is then added to the PyChain Ledger and stored there. Then to validate the PyChain Ledger to make sure the transaction occured you can click validate chain. If the transaction occured the ouput will state True.
